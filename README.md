# Van Hailin’!

*Van Hailin’!* is a web app, optimized for mobile screens, which aims to simplify and consolidate the tools needed to coordinate a vanpool. Vanpool members can quickly see and update the dates they are riding; attach messages to a specific day; see who is driving or riding in the van each day, along with their contact information; and see an automatic calculation of how much they owe the vanpool each month based on their participation.

## Built With

*VH!* is built on the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) along with Redux and Redux Sagas. It makes heavy use of Moment.js to work with times and dates, and is styled on top of the Cutestrap CSS framework.
